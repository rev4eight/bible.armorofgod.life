Titus 1:1 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the choice ones of God, and an acknowledging of truth that [is] according to piety,
Titus 1:2 upon hope of life age-during, which God, who doth not lie, did promise before times of ages,
Titus 1:3 (and He manifested in proper times His word,) in preaching, which I was entrusted with, according to a charge of God our Saviour,
Titus 1:4 to Titus -- true child according to a common faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour!
Titus 1:5 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that the things lacking thou mayest arrange, and mayest set down in every city elders, as I did appoint to thee;
Titus 1:6 if any one is blameless, of one wife a husband, having children stedfast, not under accusation of riotous living or insubordinate --
Titus 1:7 for it behoveth the overseer to be blameless, as God's steward, not self-pleased, nor irascible, not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre;
Titus 1:8 but a lover of strangers, a lover of good men, sober-minded, righteous, kind, self-controlled,
Titus 1:9 holding -- according to the teaching -- to the stedfast word, that he may be able also to exhort in the sound teaching, and the gainsayers to convict;
Titus 1:10 for there are many both insubordinate, vain-talkers, and mind-deceivers -- especially they of the circumcision --
Titus 1:11 whose mouth it behoveth to stop, who whole households do overturn, teaching what things it behoveth not, for filthy lucre's sake.
Titus 1:12 A certain one of them, a prophet of their own, said -- `Cretans! always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies!'
Titus 1:13 this testimony is true; for which cause convict them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
Titus 1:14 not giving heed to Jewish fables and commands of men, turning themselves away from the truth;
Titus 1:15 all things, indeed, [are] pure to the pure, and to the defiled and unstedfast [is] nothing pure, but of them defiled [are] even the mind and the conscience;
Titus 1:16 God they profess to know, and in the works they deny [Him], being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work disapproved.
Titus 2:1 And thou -- be speaking what doth become the sound teaching;
Titus 2:2 aged men to be temperate, grave, sober, sound in the faith, in the love, in the endurance;
Titus 2:3 aged women, in like manner, in deportment as doth become sacred persons, not false accusers, to much wine not enslaved, of good things teachers,
Titus 2:4 that they may make the young women sober-minded, to be lovers of [their] husbands, lovers of [their] children,
Titus 2:5 sober, pure, keepers of [their own] houses, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of.
Titus 2:6 The younger men, in like manner, be exhorting to be sober-minded;
Titus 2:7 concerning all things thyself showing a pattern of good works; in the teaching uncorruptedness, gravity, incorruptibility,
Titus 2:8 discourse sound, irreprehensible, that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning you.
Titus 2:9 Servants -- to their own masters [are] to be subject, in all things to be well-pleasing, not gainsaying,
Titus 2:10 not purloining, but showing all good stedfastness, that the teaching of God our Saviour they may adorn in all things.
Titus 2:11 For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men,
Titus 2:12 teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly desires, soberly and righteously and piously we may live in the present age,
Titus 2:13 waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,
Titus 2:14 who did give himself for us, that he might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works;
Titus 2:15 these things be speaking, and exhorting, and convicting, with all charge; let no one despise thee!
Titus 3:1 Remind them to be subject to principalities and authorities, to obey rule, unto every good work to be ready,
Titus 3:2 of no one to speak evil, not to be quarrelsome -- gentle, showing all meekness to all men,
Titus 3:3 for we were once -- also we -- thoughtless, disobedient, led astray, serving desires and pleasures manifold, in malice and envy living, odious -- hating one another;
Titus 3:4 and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Saviour did appear
Titus 3:5 (not by works that [are] in righteousness that we did but according to His kindness,) He did save us, through a bathing of regeneration, and a renewing of the Holy Spirit,
Titus 3:6 which He poured upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour,
Titus 3:7 that having been declared righteous by His grace, heirs we may become according to the hope of life age-during.
Titus 3:8 Stedfast [is] the word; and concerning these things I counsel thee to affirm fully, that they may be thoughtful, to be leading in good works -- who have believed God; these are the good and profitable things to men,
Titus 3:9 and foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about law, stand away from -- for they are unprofitable and vain.
Titus 3:10 A sectarian man, after a first and second admonition be rejecting,
Titus 3:11 having known that he hath been subverted who [is] such, and doth sin, being self-condemned.
Titus 3:12 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis, for there to winter I have determined.
Titus 3:13 Zenas the lawyer and Apollos bring diligently on their way, that nothing to them may be lacking,
Titus 3:14 and let them learn -- ours also -- to be leading in good works to the necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.
Titus 3:15 Salute thee do all those with me; salute those loving us in faith; the grace [is] with you all!
