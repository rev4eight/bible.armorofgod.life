Proverbs 1:1 Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
Proverbs 1:2 For knowing wisdom and instruction, For understanding sayings of intelligence,
Proverbs 1:3 For receiving the instruction of wisdom, Righteousness, judgment, and uprightness,
Proverbs 1:4 For giving to simple ones -- prudence, To a youth -- knowledge and discretion.
Proverbs 1:5 (The wise doth hear and increaseth learning, And the intelligent doth obtain counsels.)
Proverbs 1:6 For understanding a proverb and its sweetness, Words of the wise and their acute sayings.
Proverbs 1:7 Fear of Jehovah [is] a beginning of knowledge, Wisdom and instruction fools have despised!
Proverbs 1:8 Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, And leave not the law of thy mother,
Proverbs 1:9 For a graceful wreath [are] they to thy head, And chains to thy neck.
Proverbs 1:10 My son, if sinners entice thee be not willing.
Proverbs 1:11 If they say, `Come with us, we lay wait for blood, We watch secretly for the innocent without cause,
Proverbs 1:12 We swallow them as Sheol -- alive, And whole -- as those going down [to] the pit,
Proverbs 1:13 Every precious substance we find, We fill our houses [with] spoil,
Proverbs 1:14 Thy lot thou dost cast among us, One purse is -- to all of us.'
Proverbs 1:15 My son! go not in the way with them, Withhold thy foot from their path,
Proverbs 1:16 For their feet to evil do run, And they haste to shed blood.
Proverbs 1:17 Surely in vain is the net spread out before the eyes of any bird.
Proverbs 1:18 And they for their own blood lay wait, They watch secretly for their own lives.
Proverbs 1:19 So [are] the paths of every gainer of dishonest gain, The life of its owners it taketh.
Proverbs 1:20 Wisdom in an out-place crieth aloud, In broad places she giveth forth her voice,
Proverbs 1:21 At the head of the multitudes she calleth, In the openings of the gates, In the city her sayings she saith:
Proverbs 1:22 `Till when, ye simple, do ye love simplicity? And have scorners their scorning desired? And do fools hate knowledge?
Proverbs 1:23 Turn back at my reproof, lo, I pour forth to you my spirit, I make known my words with you.
Proverbs 1:24 Because I have called, and ye refuse, I stretched out my hand, and none is attending,
Proverbs 1:25 And ye slight all my counsel, And my reproof ye have not desired.
Proverbs 1:26 I also in your calamity do laugh, I deride when your fear cometh,
Proverbs 1:27 When your fear cometh as destruction, And your calamity as a hurricane doth come, When on you come adversity and distress.
Proverbs 1:28 Then they call me, and I do not answer, They seek me earnestly, and find me not.
Proverbs 1:29 Because that they have hated knowledge, And the fear of Jehovah have not chosen.
Proverbs 1:30 They have not consented to my counsel, They have despised all my reproof,
Proverbs 1:31 And they eat of the fruit of their way, And from their own counsels they are filled.
Proverbs 1:32 For the turning of the simple slayeth them, And the security of the foolish destroyeth them.
Proverbs 1:33 And whoso is hearkening to me dwelleth confidently, And [is] quiet from fear of evil!'
Proverbs 2:1 My son, if thou dost accept my sayings, And my commands dost lay up with thee,
Proverbs 2:2 To cause thine ear to attend to wisdom, Thou inclinest thy heart to understanding,
Proverbs 2:3 For, if for intelligence thou callest, For understanding givest forth thy voice,
Proverbs 2:4 If thou dost seek her as silver, And as hid treasures searchest for her,
Proverbs 2:5 Then understandest thou fear of Jehovah, And knowledge of God thou findest.
Proverbs 2:6 For Jehovah giveth wisdom, From His mouth knowledge and understanding.
Proverbs 2:7 Even to lay up for the upright substance, A shield for those walking uprightly.
Proverbs 2:8 To keep the paths of judgment, And the way of His saints He preserveth.
Proverbs 2:9 Then understandest thou righteousness, And judgment, and uprightness -- every good path.
Proverbs 2:10 For wisdom cometh into thy heart, And knowledge to thy soul is pleasant,
Proverbs 2:11 Thoughtfulness doth watch over thee, Understanding doth keep thee,
Proverbs 2:12 To deliver thee from an evil way, From any speaking froward things,
Proverbs 2:13 Who are forsaking paths of uprightness, To walk in ways of darkness,
Proverbs 2:14 Who are rejoicing to do evil, They delight in frowardness of the wicked,
Proverbs 2:15 Whose paths [are] crooked, Yea, they are perverted in their ways.
Proverbs 2:16 To deliver thee from the strange woman, From the stranger who hath made smooth her sayings,
Proverbs 2:17 Who is forsaking the guide of her youth, And the covenant of her God hath forgotten.
Proverbs 2:18 For her house hath inclined unto death, And unto Rephaim her paths.
Proverbs 2:19 None going in unto her turn back, Nor do they reach the paths of life.
Proverbs 2:20 That thou dost go in the way of the good, And the paths of the righteous dost keep.
Proverbs 2:21 For the upright do inhabit the earth, And the perfect are left in it,
Proverbs 2:22 And the wicked from the earth are cut off, And treacherous dealers plucked out of it!
Proverbs 3:1 My son! my law forget not, And my commands let thy heart keep,
Proverbs 3:2 For length of days and years, Life and peace they do add to thee.
Proverbs 3:3 Let not kindness and truth forsake thee, Bind them on thy neck, Write them on the tablet of thy heart,
Proverbs 3:4 And find grace and good understanding In the eyes of God and man.
Proverbs 3:5 Trust unto Jehovah with all thy heart, And unto thine own understanding lean not.
Proverbs 3:6 In all thy ways know thou Him, And He doth make straight thy paths.
Proverbs 3:7 Be not wise in thine own eyes, Fear Jehovah, and turn aside from evil.
Proverbs 3:8 Healing it is to thy navel, And moistening to thy bones.
Proverbs 3:9 Honour Jehovah from thy substance, And from the beginning of all thine increase;
Proverbs 3:10 And filled are thy barns [with] plenty, And [with] new wine thy presses break forth.
Proverbs 3:11 Chastisement of Jehovah, my son, despise not, And be not vexed with His reproof,
Proverbs 3:12 For whom Jehovah loveth He reproveth, Even as a father the son He is pleased with.
Proverbs 3:13 O the happiness of a man [who] hath found wisdom, And of a man [who] bringeth forth understanding.
Proverbs 3:14 For better [is] her merchandise Than the merchandise of silver, And than gold -- her increase.
Proverbs 3:15 Precious she [is] above rubies, And all thy pleasures are not comparable to her.
Proverbs 3:16 Length of days [is] in her right hand, In her left [are] wealth and honour.
Proverbs 3:17 Her ways [are] ways of pleasantness, And all her paths [are] peace.
Proverbs 3:18 A tree of life she [is] to those laying hold on her, And whoso is retaining her [is] happy.
Proverbs 3:19 Jehovah by wisdom did found the earth, He prepared the heavens by understanding.
Proverbs 3:20 By His knowledge depths have been rent, And clouds do drop dew.
Proverbs 3:21 My son! let them not turn from thine eyes, Keep thou wisdom and thoughtfulness,
Proverbs 3:22 And they are life to thy soul, and grace to thy neck.
Proverbs 3:23 Then thou goest thy way confidently, And thy foot doth not stumble.
Proverbs 3:24 If thou liest down, thou art not afraid, Yea, thou hast lain down, And sweet hath been thy sleep.
Proverbs 3:25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, And of the desolation of the wicked when it cometh.
Proverbs 3:26 For Jehovah is at thy side, And He hath kept thy foot from capture.
Proverbs 3:27 Withhold not good from its owners, When thy hand [is] toward God to do [it].
Proverbs 3:28 Say not thou to thy friend, `Go, and return, and to-morrow I give,' And substance with thee.
Proverbs 3:29 Devise not against thy neighbour evil, And he sitting confidently with thee.
Proverbs 3:30 Strive not with a man without cause, If he have not done thee evil.
Proverbs 3:31 Be not envious of a man of violence, Nor fix thou on any of his ways.
Proverbs 3:32 For an abomination to Jehovah [is] the perverted, And with the upright [is] His secret counsel.
Proverbs 3:33 The curse of Jehovah [is] in the house of the wicked. And the habitation of the righteous He blesseth.
Proverbs 3:34 If the scorners He doth scorn, Yet to the humble He doth give grace.
Proverbs 3:35 Honour do the wise inherit, And fools are bearing away shame!
Proverbs 4:1 Hear, ye sons, the instruction of a father, And give attention to know understanding.
Proverbs 4:2 For good learning I have given to you, My law forsake not.
Proverbs 4:3 For, a son I have been to my father -- tender, And an only one before my mother.
Proverbs 4:4 And he directeth me, and he saith to me: `Let thy heart retain my words, Keep my commands, and live.
Proverbs 4:5 Get wisdom, get understanding, Do not forget, nor turn away From the sayings of my mouth.
Proverbs 4:6 Forsake her not, and she doth preserve thee, Love her, and she doth keep thee.
Proverbs 4:7 The first thing [is] wisdom -- get wisdom, And with all thy getting get understanding.
Proverbs 4:8 Exalt her, and she doth lift thee up, She honoureth thee, when thou dost embrace her.
Proverbs 4:9 She giveth to thy head a wreath of grace, A crown of beauty she doth give thee freely.
Proverbs 4:10 Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, And years of life [are] multiplied to thee.
Proverbs 4:11 In a way of wisdom I have directed thee, I have caused thee to tread in paths of uprightness.
Proverbs 4:12 In thy walking thy step is not straitened, And if thou runnest, thou stumblest not.
Proverbs 4:13 Lay hold on instruction, do not desist, Keep her, for she [is] thy life.
Proverbs 4:14 Into the path of the wicked enter not, And be not happy in a way of evil doers.
Proverbs 4:15 Avoid it, pass not over into it, Turn aside from it, and pass on.
Proverbs 4:16 For they sleep not if they do not evil, And their sleep hath been taken violently away, If they cause not [some] to stumble.
Proverbs 4:17 For they have eaten bread of wickedness, And wine of violence they drink.
Proverbs 4:18 And the path of the righteous [is] as a shining light, Going and brightening till the day is established,
Proverbs 4:19 The way of the wicked [is] as darkness, They have not known at what they stumble.
Proverbs 4:20 My son, to my words give attention, To my sayings incline thine ear,
Proverbs 4:21 Let them not turn aside from thine eyes, Preserve them in the midst of thy heart.
Proverbs 4:22 For life they [are] to those finding them, And to all their flesh healing.
Proverbs 4:23 Above every charge keep thy heart, For out of it [are] the outgoings of life.
Proverbs 4:24 Turn aside from thee a froward mouth, And perverse lips put far from thee,
Proverbs 4:25 Thine eyes do look straightforward, And thine eyelids look straight before thee.
Proverbs 4:26 Ponder thou the path of thy feet, And all thy ways [are] established.
Proverbs 4:27 Incline not [to] the right or to the left, Turn aside thy foot from evil!
Proverbs 5:1 My son! to my wisdom give attention, To mine understanding incline thine ear,
Proverbs 5:2 To observe thoughtfulness, And knowledge do thy lips keep.
Proverbs 5:3 For the lips of a strange woman drop honey, And smoother than oil [is] her mouth,
Proverbs 5:4 And her latter end [is] bitter as wormwood, Sharp as a sword [with] mouths.
Proverbs 5:5 Her feet are going down to death, Sheol do her steps take hold of.
Proverbs 5:6 The path of life -- lest thou ponder, Moved have her paths -- thou knowest not.
Proverbs 5:7 And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And turn not from sayings of my mouth.
Proverbs 5:8 Keep far from off her thy way, And come not near unto the opening of her house,
Proverbs 5:9 Lest thou give to others thy honour, And thy years to the fierce,
Proverbs 5:10 Lest strangers be filled [with] thy power, And thy labours in the house of a stranger,
Proverbs 5:11 And thou hast howled in thy latter end, In the consumption of thy flesh and thy food,
Proverbs 5:12 And hast said, `How have I hated instruction, And reproof hath my heart despised,
Proverbs 5:13 And I have not hearkened to the voice of my directors, And to my teachers have not inclined mine ear.
Proverbs 5:14 As a little thing I have been all evil, In the midst of an assembly and a company.
Proverbs 5:15 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, Even flowing ones out of thine own well.
Proverbs 5:16 Let thy fountains be scattered abroad, In broad places rivulets of waters.
Proverbs 5:17 Let them be to thee for thyself, And not to strangers with thee.
Proverbs 5:18 Let thy fountain be blessed, And rejoice because of the wife of thy youth,
Proverbs 5:19 A hind of loves, and a roe of grace! Let her loves satisfy thee at all times, In her love magnify thyself continually.
Proverbs 5:20 And why dost thou magnify thyself, My son, with a stranger? And embrace the bosom of a strange woman?
Proverbs 5:21 For over-against the eyes of Jehovah are the ways of each, And all his paths He is pondering.
Proverbs 5:22 His own iniquities do capture the wicked, And with the ropes of his sin he is holden.
Proverbs 5:23 He dieth without instruction, And in the abundance of his folly magnifieth himself!
Proverbs 6:1 My son! if thou hast been surety for thy friend, Hast stricken for a stranger thy hand,
Proverbs 6:2 Hast been snared with sayings of thy mouth, Hast been captured with sayings of thy mouth,
Proverbs 6:3 Do this now, my son, and be delivered, For thou hast come into the hand of thy friend. Go, trample on thyself, and strengthen thy friend,
Proverbs 6:4 Give not sleep to thine eyes, And slumber to thine eyelids,
Proverbs 6:5 Be delivered as a roe from the hand, And as a bird from the hand of a fowler.
Proverbs 6:6 Go unto the ant, O slothful one, See her ways and be wise;
Proverbs 6:7 Which hath not captain, overseer, and ruler,
Proverbs 6:8 She doth prepare in summer her bread, She hath gathered in harvest her food.
Proverbs 6:9 Till when, O slothful one, dost thou lie? When dost thou arise from thy sleep?
Proverbs 6:10 A little sleep, a little slumber, A little clasping of the hands to rest,
Proverbs 6:11 And thy poverty hath come as a traveller, And thy want as an armed man.
Proverbs 6:12 A man of worthlessness, a man of iniquity, Walking [with] perverseness of mouth,
Proverbs 6:13 Winking with his eyes, speaking with his feet, Directing with his fingers,
Proverbs 6:14 Frowardness [is] in his heart, devising evil at all times, Contentions he sendeth forth.
Proverbs 6:15 Therefore suddenly cometh his calamity, Instantly he is broken -- and no healing.
Proverbs 6:16 These six hath Jehovah hated, Yea, seven [are] abominations to His soul.
Proverbs 6:17 Eyes high -- tongues false -- And hands shedding innocent blood --
Proverbs 6:18 A heart devising thoughts of vanity -- Feet hasting to run to evil --
Proverbs 6:19 A false witness [who] doth breathe out lies -- And one sending forth contentions between brethren.
Proverbs 6:20 Keep, my son, the command of thy father, And leave not the law of thy mother.
Proverbs 6:21 Bind them on thy heart continually, Tie them on thy neck.
Proverbs 6:22 In thy going up and down, it leadeth thee, In thy lying down, it watcheth over thee, And thou hast awaked -- it talketh [with] thee.
Proverbs 6:23 For a lamp [is] the command, And the law a light, And a way of life [are] reproofs of instruction,
Proverbs 6:24 To preserve thee from an evil woman, From the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
Proverbs 6:25 Desire not her beauty in thy heart, And let her not take thee with her eyelids.

Proverbs 6:27 Doth a man take fire into his bosom, And are his garments not burnt?
Proverbs 6:28 Doth a man walk on the hot coals, And are his feet not scorched?
Proverbs 6:29 So [is] he who hath gone in unto the wife of his neighbour, None who doth touch her is innocent.
Proverbs 6:30 They do not despise the thief, When he stealeth to fill his soul when he is hungry,
Proverbs 6:31 And being found he repayeth sevenfold, All the substance of his house he giveth.
Proverbs 6:32 He who committeth adultery [with] a woman lacketh heart, He is destroying his soul who doth it.
Proverbs 6:33 A stroke and shame he doth find, And his reproach is not wiped away,
Proverbs 6:34 For jealousy [is] the fury of a man, And he doth not spare in a day of vengeance.
Proverbs 6:35 He accepteth not the appearance of any atonement, Yea, he doth not consent, Though thou dost multiply bribes!
Proverbs 7:1 My son! keep my sayings, And my commands lay up with thee.
Proverbs 7:2 Keep my commands, and live, And my law as the pupil of thine eye.
Proverbs 7:3 Bind them on thy fingers, Write them on the tablet of thy heart.
Proverbs 7:4 Say to wisdom, `My sister Thou [art].' And cry to understanding, `Kinswoman!'
Proverbs 7:5 To preserve thee from a strange woman, From a stranger who hath made smooth her sayings.
Proverbs 7:6 For, at a window of my house, Through my casement I have looked out,
Proverbs 7:7 And I do see among the simple ones, I discern among the sons, A young man lacking understanding,
Proverbs 7:8 Passing on in the street, near her corner, And the way [to] her house he doth step,
Proverbs 7:9 In the twilight -- in the evening of day, In the darkness of night and blackness.
Proverbs 7:10 And, lo, a woman to meet him -- (A harlot's dress, and watchful of heart,
Proverbs 7:11 Noisy she [is], and stubborn, In her house her feet rest not.
Proverbs 7:12 Now in an out-place, now in broad places, And near every corner she lieth in wait) --
Proverbs 7:13 And she laid hold on him, and kissed him, She hath hardened her face, and saith to him,
Proverbs 7:14 `Sacrifices of peace-offerings [are] by me, To-day I have completed my vows.
Proverbs 7:15 Therefore I have come forth to meet thee, To seek earnestly thy face, and I find thee.
Proverbs 7:16 [With] ornamental coverings I decked my couch, Carved works -- cotton of Egypt.
Proverbs 7:17 I sprinkled my bed -- myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
Proverbs 7:18 Come, we are filled [with] loves till the morning, We delight ourselves in loves.
Proverbs 7:19 For the man is not in his house, He hath gone on a long journey.
Proverbs 7:20 A bag of money he hath taken in his hand, At the day of the new moon he cometh to his house.'
Proverbs 7:21 She turneth him aside with the abundance of her speech, With the flattery of her lips she forceth him.
Proverbs 7:22 He is going after her straightway, As an ox unto the slaughter he cometh, And as a fetter unto the chastisement of a fool,
Proverbs 7:23 Till an arrow doth split his liver, As a bird hath hastened unto a snare, And hath not known that it [is] for its life.
Proverbs 7:24 And now, ye sons, hearken to me, And give attention to sayings of my mouth.
Proverbs 7:25 Let not thy heart turn unto her ways, Do not wander in her paths,
Proverbs 7:26 For many [are] the wounded she caused to fall, And mighty [are] all her slain ones.
Proverbs 7:27 The ways of Sheol -- her house, Going down unto inner chambers of death!
Proverbs 8:1 Doth not wisdom call? And understanding give forth her voice?
Proverbs 8:2 At the head of high places by the way, Between the paths she hath stood,
Proverbs 8:3 At the side of the gates, at the mouth of the city, The entrance of the openings, she crieth aloud,
Proverbs 8:4 `Unto you, O men, I call, And my voice [is] unto the sons of men.
Proverbs 8:5 Understand, ye simple ones, prudence, And ye fools, understand the heart,
Proverbs 8:6 Hearken, for noble things I speak, And the opening of my lips [is] uprightness.

Proverbs 8:17 I love those loving me, And those seeking me earnestly do find me.
Proverbs 8:18 Wealth and honour [are] with me, Lasting substance and righteousness.
Proverbs 8:19 Better [is] my fruit than gold, even fine gold, And mine increase than choice silver.
Proverbs 8:20 In a path of righteousness I cause to walk, In midst of paths of judgment,
Proverbs 8:21 To cause my lovers to inherit substance, Yea, their treasures I fill.
Proverbs 8:22 Jehovah possessed me -- the beginning of His way, Before His works since then.
Proverbs 8:23 From the age I was anointed, from the first, From former states of the earth.
Proverbs 8:24 In there being no depths, I was brought forth, In there being no fountains heavy [with] waters,
Proverbs 8:25 Before mountains were sunk, Before heights, I was brought forth.
Proverbs 8:26 While He had not made the earth, and out-places, And the top of the dusts of the world.
Proverbs 8:27 In His preparing the heavens I [am] there, In His decreeing a circle on the face of the deep,
Proverbs 8:28 In His strengthening clouds above, In His making strong fountains of the deep,
Proverbs 8:29 In His setting for the sea its limit, And the waters transgress not His command, In His decreeing the foundations of earth,
Proverbs 8:30 Then I am near Him, a workman, And I am a delight -- day by day. Rejoicing before Him at all times,
Proverbs 8:31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of His earth, And my delights [are] with the sons of men.

Proverbs 8:33 Hear instruction, and be wise, and slight not.
Proverbs 8:34 O the happiness of the man hearkening to me, To watch at my doors day by day, To watch at the door-posts of my entrance.

Proverbs 8:36 And whoso is missing me, is wronging his soul, All hating me have loved death!
Proverbs 9:1 Wisdom hath builded her house, She hath hewn out her pillars -- seven.
Proverbs 9:2 She hath slaughtered her slaughter, She hath mingled her wine, Yea, she hath arranged her table.
Proverbs 9:3 She hath sent forth her damsels, She crieth on the tops of the high places of the city:
Proverbs 9:4 `Who [is] simple? let him turn aside hither.' Whoso lacketh heart: she hath said to him,
